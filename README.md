## Part-01: Document the steps you took to install Laravel.

As an AI language model, I don't have access to an operating system, so I cannot provide a detailed description of how to install Laravel on your specific system. However, I can give you an overview of the general steps involved in installing Laravel using Composer:

    Install Composer: Before installing Laravel, you will need to install Composer on your system. Composer is a dependency manager for PHP that is used to install and manage Laravel and its dependencies. You can download and install Composer from the official website at https://getcomposer.org/.

    Create a new Laravel project: Once Composer is installed, you can create a new Laravel project by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

### Create Project (CMD): composer create-project laravel/laravel project-name

This will create a new Laravel project in a directory named project-name, and will install all of Laravel's dependencies.

    Configure the .env file: Laravel uses an .env file to store configuration settings for your application. You will need to configure this file to specify your database credentials and other settings specific to your environment. You can copy the .env.example file to create a new .env file, and then edit it to specify your settings.

    Run the Laravel development server: Once your project is set up and configured, you can run the Laravel development server by executing the following command from the root directory of your project:

### Running Project(CMD): php artisan serve

    This will start the development server on port 8000 by default, and you can access your Laravel application by visiting http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.

    These are the basic steps for installing Laravel using Composer. However, there may be additional steps required depending on your specific environment and project requirements. You should consult the official Laravel documentation for more detailed instructions and guidance.
